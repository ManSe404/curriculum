                <h3>Data Science and Development</h3>
                <p><strong>This text has been generated by AI (Model LLama2):</strong></p>
                <p>My professional journey has led me through diverse technical and multidisciplinary settings,
                    allowing me to generate a comprehensive skill set across various facets of the tech landscape.
                    I've immersed myself in the world of machine learning, mastering the craft of designing intelligent
                    algorithms and predictive models. Natural language processing has been a significant focal point,
                    enabling me to create solutions for tasks such as text summarization and chatbot development.</p>

                <p>I've also ventured into the realm of document analysis, where I've actively worked on systems
                    to autonomously categorize and structure extensive textual data. My experience in data extraction,
                    particularly through NLP techniques, has proven useful for unlocking profound insights from
                    complex documents.</p>

                    <p>Additionally, my experience extends to vector databases and embedding models, harnessing
                    these technologies to enhance data comprehension and representation.
                    These tools have played a pivotal role in optimizing the efficiency and effectiveness of
                    data-driven solutions.</p>

                    <p>Within the data domain, I've conducted in-depth statistical analysis, utilizing data-driven
                    insights to drive strategic decision-making. My journey into generative AI has been an exhilarating
                    exploration, involving cutting-edge technologies like RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation),
                    enabling the creation of content that seamlessly combines creativity and relevance.</p>

                    <p>Throughout these endeavors, my primary programming language of choice has consistently been Python,
                    owing to its exceptional versatility and an expansive array of libraries that facilitate the
                    seamless implementation of solutions. In tandem, I have also delved into JavaScript to
                    enhance web-based projects and solutions.</p>

                <h3>Science and Research</h3>
                <p><strong>This text has been generated by OpenAI (GPT-4 model)</strong></p>
                <p>A substantial portion of my research background has been dedicated to the field of Cardiovascular
                    Physiology and Sport Science. Currently, I am actively engaged in pursuing a Ph.D. thesis
                    with a distinct focus on the application of neural networks in biomedicine, which involves
                    research at the intersection of data science and medical studies. Over the years, I have
                    contributed significantly to both local and international projects, assuming various
                    responsibilities that have honed my expertise.</p>
                <p>
                    One notable aspect of my experience has been my involvement in clinical settings, where I have
                    interfaced with a diverse set of tools and equipment such as ECG (Electrocardiogram) and CPET
                    (Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing) equipment. This hands-on experience in clinical environments
                    has provided valuable insights into the practical application of my research and the translation
                    of scientific findings into real-world healthcare settings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, my academic and research journey in Exercise Physiology and Sport Science, coupled
                    with my ongoing doctoral work, has equipped
                    me with a rich and diverse skill set. This background positions me as a versatile contributor
                    capable of addressing multifaceted challenges in research, data analysis, and clinical applications.
