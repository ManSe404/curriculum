                <h3>Data Science and Development</h3>

                <p>As a proficient data scientist, I have experience in Python, SQL and LabView, with hands-on experience in frameworks
                    like Flask, FastAPI, PyTorch, PySpark, LangChain Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Matplotlib,... Additionally, I am skilled in using Docker, Azure,
                    Linux, Bash enabling me to develop robust and scalable applications. I have worked in various
                    projects from building Machine Learning models and AI applications, to being involved in Software Engineering,
                    Data Extraction and Analysis from both initial phases and planning to optimizing performance of the application.</p>

                <h3>Science and Research</h3>
                <p>A substantial portion of my research background has been dedicated to the field of Cardiovascular
                    Physiology and Sport Science. Currently, I am actively engaged in pursuing a Ph.D. thesis
                    with a distinct focus on the application of neural networks in biomedicine, which involves
                    research at the intersection of data science and medical studies. Over the years, I have
                    contributed significantly to both local and international projects, assuming various
                    responsibilities that have honed my expertise.</p>
                <p>
                    One notable aspect of my experience has been my involvement in clinical settings, where I have
                    interfaced with a diverse set of tools and equipment such as ECG (Electrocardiogram) and CPET
                    (Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing) equipment. This hands-on experience in clinical environments
                    has provided valuable insights into the practical application of my research and the translation
                    of scientific findings into real-world healthcare settings.
