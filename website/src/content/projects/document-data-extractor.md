## The problem

Unstructured documents carrying the data a business actually runs on, and no way to get at
it except by reading them. Extracting it reliably is a machine learning problem; exposing
it as a service other systems can depend on is an engineering one. Most efforts solve the
first, demo well, and stop — which leaves the organisation with a proof that it is
possible and nothing it can use.

## The approach

Built the extraction and classification services from scratch and led the team that
delivered them:

- **Deep learning over unstructured text**, with embedding-based representations doing the
  work that keyword and rule-based matching could not.
- **Document processing microservices**, designed so extraction and classification were
  separately deployable and could scale independently of each other.
- **ETL into Synapse and the data lake**, so extracted output landed somewhere downstream
  systems could actually consume rather than in a service's own storage.
- **A team of six led and mentored through delivery**, with me owning the design and
  carrying it to production instead of handing over a prototype.

## The outcome

Production services, built from the ground up and delivered — which is the distinction
that matters here, since the hard part of extraction is never making it work once. It is
making it work every time, on documents nobody anticipated.
