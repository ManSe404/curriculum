## The problem

Single-shot prompting falls apart once a task has real structure. Synthesizing insight
across many sources, deciding what a user needs before they ask, and preparing them for a
conversation are not one operation — they are sequences of dependent steps, each of which
can fail or need to branch. That needs an architecture, not a longer prompt.

## The approach

I worked on the agentic layer of the platform — the part that decides what happens next:

- **Orchestration graphs** defining how agents hand off, branch, and converge, so
  multi-step reasoning is explicit and inspectable rather than emergent from a single
  model call.
- **Agentic flows** for tasks that need several coordinated steps, each with its own tools
  and its own success criteria.
- **Insights summarization**, synthesizing across sources so the output reflects the whole
  picture instead of restating whichever document was retrieved first.
- **Suggestion generation**, surfacing what is likely to matter next rather than waiting
  to be queried.
- **Pre-meeting summaries**, assembling the relevant context ahead of a conversation so
  participants arrive prepared.

## The outcome

The system moved from answering questions to anticipating them. Making orchestration an
explicit graph rather than an implicit chain is what made that tractable — you can reason
about where a multi-agent flow went wrong when the flow itself is a structure you can
look at.
