title: Large-Scale Document ETL Pipelines
category: Cloud / AWS
summary: Serverless ingestion and transformation pipelines moving documents at scale through load, parse, transform, and delivery — the substrate the summarization and risk systems run on.
order: 10
org: 404 Solutions
client: Provectus
period: 2024 — Present
impact:
  - Throughput scales with demand instead of with provisioned capacity
  - Per-document state tracking, so a failure retries one document rather than a batch
  - Pipeline runs as an inspectable state machine, not a chain of triggers
  - The ingestion layer underneath the document summarizer and RiskFocus
stack:
  - Python
  - AWS Lambda
  - Step Functions
  - DynamoDB
  - S3
  - AWS SAM
  - ECS
  - EC2

## The problem

The document intelligence sitting above these pipelines — summarization, risk extraction —
is only ever as good as what reaches it. Volume at this scale arrives unevenly: quiet for
hours, then a burst that would swamp anything sized for the average. Provision for the
peak and you pay for idle capacity most of the time; provision for the mean and you drop
documents exactly when there are most of them.

## The approach

Serverless ingestion and transformation on AWS, structured as explicit workflow stages
rather than as a chain of triggers:

- **Load** — documents landed in S3 as the durable entry point, decoupling arrival from
  processing so a burst queues instead of failing.
- **Parse** — heterogeneous formats normalised into something the downstream stages can
  rely on without special-casing every source.
- **Transform** — processing split across Lambda for short bursty work and ECS for jobs
  that need to run longer than a function reasonably should.
- **Deliver** — results written back to S3 for the summarization and risk systems that
  consume them.
- **Step Functions orchestration**, so the pipeline is a state machine you can inspect and
  resume rather than something you reconstruct from logs after it breaks.
- **DynamoDB for per-document state**, so a failure retries one document instead of
  reprocessing the batch it happened to arrive in.
- **AWS SAM for reproducible deploys**, keeping the infrastructure a definition rather than
  a sequence of console actions.

## The outcome

Throughput scales with demand rather than with provisioned capacity — which is where both
the reliability and the drop in operational overhead come from. It is also the layer the
[document summarizer](/webpage/projects/ai-document-summarizer) and
[RiskFocus](/webpage/projects/riskfocus) sit on: neither of them has to think about
ingestion, because this does it for them.
