## The problem

Clinical trials for familial cardiomyopathies run into a hard limit: the trials you most
want to run are frequently the ones you cannot ethically or practically run on patients.
That leaves a permanent gap between what is known and what could be known — and it is a
gap computation can partly close, but only if the models are faithful enough to be worth
trusting with a clinical question.

## The approach

SILICOFCM is an EU Horizon 2020 platform for in silico clinical trials — running trials
computationally, on models, where running them on people is not an option. My contribution
covered the signal and modelling side:

- **ECG analysis**, processing cardiac electrical signal data into features the platform
  could actually model against.
- **CPET analysis**, working with cardiopulmonary exercise testing data as a window onto
  cardiac function under load rather than at rest.
- **Statistical modelling and biostatistics** across the biomedical datasets, feeding both
  the platform and the peer-reviewed research built on it.
- **Patient-specific 3D heart modelling**, the component that makes a simulated trial
  specific to an individual instead of generic to a population.

## The outcome

Work that fed the platform itself and the publications around it, aimed at making
personalized cardiac medicine tractable — treating a patient as their own model rather
than as a member of a cohort whose average they may not resemble.
